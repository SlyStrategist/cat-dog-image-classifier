# cat-dog-image-classifier
A simple image classifier based on CNN that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs.
I have put the dataset inside a .pickle file. Whole algorithm is written in jupyter notebook using keras library in tensorflow.
X.pickle contains image dataset inputs. Y.pickle contains lables for those images.
CatDogCNN is the code for the model.
Dataset is the code for equipping the daytaset into the pickle files and finally in form of usable arrays.
catdogCNN80x3 is the final model with permanent weights and biases.
